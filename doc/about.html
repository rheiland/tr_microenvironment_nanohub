<h2 ><strong>Background</strong></h2>
Multicellular simulations need to model the chemical environment of cells to study the effect of chemical substrates on different cell behaviors. Moreover, cells secrete and absorb substrates from their environment thus affecting chemical gradients in the environment.
PhysiCell uses BioFVM to simulate the chemical environment of cells. BioFVM is software that allows substrate diffusion models to be run on modern desktop computers. Each simulation in PhysiCell has an object microenvironment that models the diffusion and boundary conditions for chemical substrates.
<h2 ><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>

In this application, we have demonstrated the microenvironment with the help of two substrates. Users are encouraged to change different parameters to observe chemical gradients in the domain.

Two substrates oxygen and chemical A are introduced in the environment. You can modify the diffusion rate and decay rate of each substrate to obtain different diffusion lengths, we recommend using dramatically different length scales for both substrates to observe the difference clearly.

Next, you can change the boundary conditions in the application. Boundary conditions for both substrates work independently. By default, there is von Neumann boundary conditions. You can also have Dirichlet boundary conditions. You may use Dirichlet boundary conditions on all four boundaries or you can fine tune them by using only few of them. You can also change concentration of chemical substrate on each Dirichlet boundary.

In the user parameters tab there is option to create a Dirichlet nodes anywhere in the domain. You can use it to set Dirichlet node for one or both chemical substrates.

Clicking the 'Run' button will use the specified parameters and start a simulation. When clicked, it creates an "Output" widget
that can be clicked/expanded to reveal the progress (text) of the simulation. When the simulation generates output files,
they can be visualized in the "Out: Plots" tab. The "# cell frames" will be dynamically updated 
as those output files are generated by the running simulation. When the "Run" button is clicked, it toggles to a "Cancel" button
that will terminate (not pause) the simulation.

<h2><a id="instructions" name="instructions">Basic instructions</a></h2>

<p>Modify parameters in the &quot;Config Basics&quot;, &quot;Microenvironment&quot;, &quot;User Params&quot;, or &quot;Cell Types&quot; tabs. Click the &quot;Run&quot; button once you are ready.</p>

<p>To view the output results, click the &quot;Out: Plots&quot; tab, and move the slider bar to advance through simulation frames. 
Note that as the simulation runs, the &quot;# cell frames&quot; field will increase, so you can view more simulation frames.</p>

<p>If there are multiple substrates defined in the Microenvironment, you can select a different one from the drop-down widget in the Plots tab. You can also fix the colormap range of values.</p>

<p>Note that you can download full simulation data for further exploration in your tools of choice.</p>
